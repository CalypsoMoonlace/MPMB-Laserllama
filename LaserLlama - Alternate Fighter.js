Use this is you want to have the choices selected through another class feature. See for an example of this the "Draconic Bloodline" sorcerer archetype. // Note that you always want to have the choices listed in the choices attribute, because otherwise they won't be updated if they have level-dependent features
			"great weapon fighting" : { //required if "choices" is defined; has to be exactly the same as how it is written in the "choices" entry. Note the use of lower case!
				name : "Great Weapon Fighting Style", //required;
				description : "\n   " + "Reroll 1 or 2 on damage if wielding two-handed/versatile melee weapon in both hands" //required;

			},

			"two-weapon fighting" : { //has to be exactly the same as how it is written in the "choices" entry. Note the use of lower case!
				name : "Two-Weapon Fighting Style",
				description : "\n   " + "I can add my ability modifier to the damage of my off-hand attacks",

				calcChanges : { //optional; adds stuff to the calculation of attacks and/or HP

					//hp : "if (classes.known.sorcerer) {extrahp += classes.known.sorcerer.level; extrastring += \"\\n + \" + classes.known.sorcerer.level + \" from Draconic Resilience (Sorcerer)\";};", //optional; string to be run using eval() when calculating the number of HP in the HP tooltip and automation

					atkCalc : ["if (isOffHand) {output.modToDmg = true; }; ", "When engaging in two-weapon fighting, I can add my ability modifier to the damage of my off-hand attacks."], //optional; ["eval string", "explanation string"]; change something in the calculation of the Damage and To Hit of attacks; The first value in the array is stringified code that is run using eval(), the second entry is an explanation of what is being altered so that it can be displayed in a dialogue. This second entry can be left empty, as ""

					//atkAdd : ["if (WeaponName.match(/unarmed strike/i)) {fields.Description += 'Counts as magical';}; ", "My unarmed strikes count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities."], //optional;  ["eval string", "explanation string"]; works just like atkDmg, but affects the weapon attributes when they are applied to the sheet. With this you can change the weapon's description, range, damage die, attribute, etc. etc. However, this will only be applied to recognized weapons

						// Note that you need to use two back slashes for things in the eval code here, because it is first added to a string, and then run as code. See the hp for an example, with the \\n

						// For the eval strings for the attack calculations ('atkCalc' or 'atkAdd') there are some variables that you can use to test against:

							// The variable WeaponName contains the recognized weapon object name as it is used in the WeaponsList object (or "" in atkCalc if the weapon is not a recognized weapon);

							// The object "theWea" is the WeaponsList[WeaponName] object for the recognized weapon (or 'undefined' in atkCalc if the weapon is not a recognized weapon);

							// You can use the booleans 'isOffHand', 'isMeleeWeapon', 'isRangedWeapon', 'isSpell' (also true for cantrips), 'isDC'

							// If the attack is a spell that is found on the SpellList, the variable thisWeapon[3] contains the name of the entry in the SpellList

							// The object "fields" has all the values of the different fields of the attack (fields.Proficiency, fields.Mod, fields.Range, fields.Damage_Type, fields.Description, fields.To_Hit_Bonus, fields.Damage_Bonus, fields.Damage_Die, fields.Weight);

							// You can change the attributes of the "fields" object with the eval-string of atkAdd to affect what is put into the fields.

							// You can use the attributes of the "fields" object with the eval-string of atkCalc to check for things, but changing them will have no effect on the sheet.

							// With the atkCalc you have to change the "output" object in order to affect the outcome of the calculations. This object has the following attributes: output.prof (wether or not to add the proficiency bonus to the To Hit), output.die (Damage Die to use), output.mod (ability modifier), output.modToDmg (whether or not to add the ability modifier to Damage), output.magic (any magic bonus that's to be added to both To Hit and Damage), output.bHit (the To Hit bonus from the Blue Text/Modifier field), output.bDmg (the Damage bonus from the Blue Text/Modifier field), output.extraHit (a number added to the To Hit that is reserved for this eval), output.extraDmg (a number added to the damage that is reserved for this eval)
