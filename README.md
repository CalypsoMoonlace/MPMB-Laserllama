This repository is where I store scripts which add [LaserLlama](https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/laserllama)'s content to [MorePurpleMoreBetter](https://www.flapkan.com/download#charactersheets)'s scripted player sheets.

# How to import
To import any of my scripts to your own sheet, you have two options:
1. Import the master file that includes everything I've transcribed (WIP)
2. Import the Exploits file and the file of the class you want

All of my scripts require using v13.0.6 of the sheet or higher.

# About Exploits
Many of Laserllama's classes have exploits, and they are handled in a unique way with MPMB's sheets.
1. Pick them through the "Choose feature" on the top of the second page
2. All chosen exploits will be added to the notes, in a dedicated section. Exploits gained from a subclass also have their own dedicated section.
3. If you want to, you can also create a spell sheet which will contain all chosen Exploits (with "casting" time, duration, save, etc.)

Similarly, you can also create a spell sheet with *all* exploits if you want a short summary before picking, by clicking on "Make a complete spell sheet" > "With all ... spells"
