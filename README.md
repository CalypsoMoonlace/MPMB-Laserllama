This repository is where I store scripts which add [LaserLlama](https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/laserllama)'s content to [MorePurpleMoreBetter](https://www.flapkan.com/download#charactersheets)'s scripted player sheets.

# How to use
To import any of my scripts to your own sheet, you have two options:
1. Import the master file that includes everything I've transcribed (currently: Alternate Fighter, Alternate Rogue and corresponding Exploits)
2. Import the Exploits file and the file of the class you want
