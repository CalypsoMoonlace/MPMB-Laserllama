/* HOW TO ADD AN EXPLOIT 
	Exploits attributes are split into two parts:
	1. Exploit exclusive attributes
	2. Regular spell attributes
	
	Exploit exclusive attributes are detailed below:
	isExploit // REQUIRED // 
		TYPE: boolean
		Has to be set to true for ALL Exploits
		Setting it to false is the same as not putting it

	submenu // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE: string
		Determines the submenu in which the Exploit will be added, if any
		It is recommended to use a submenu related to the degree of the Exploit

	prereqeval // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE: function or, for backwards-compatibility, string that is evaluated using eval()
		This should return 'true' if the prerequisite is met or 'false' otherwise
		NOTE: Do not add the class level preqrequisite, as it is calculated using the spell level attribute
		For more details: https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/blob/master/additional%20content%20syntax/feat%20(FeatsList).js#L146

	addMod // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE: array of objects (variable length)
		This should only be used if the exploit gives a passive bonus (eg, replacing a skill check with another ability)
		For more details: https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/blob/master/additional%20content%20syntax/_common%20attributes.js#L2108 

	Regular spell attributes are detailed below:
	classes // REQUIRED //
		TYPE: array (variable length)
		This determines which classes can access this Exploit

	level // REQUIRED //
		TYPE: number (0-5)
		This is the exploit's degree

	school // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE: string
		This determines the school in which the spell belongs
		For Exploits, there are currently the following schools: Combat, Skill & Order

		You can also define a new spell school abbreviation by adding it to the "spellSchoolList" object, like so:
			spellSchoolList["NewSc"] = "new school";
		Be aware that the object name can use capitalization but the entered string can't.

	components // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE: string
		This determines the required components for the spell
		For Exploits, there might be components such as a ranged weapon, a melee weapon, a free hand, etc.

	All other spell attributes can be found at:
	https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/blob/master/additional%20content%20syntax/spell%20(SpellsList).js
